                <p>It's a sad moment: that beautiful loaf of artisan bread you bought a couple of days ago has gone hard and stale. Before you throw it out or turn it into breadcrumbs, wait! There's a simple, almost magical trick to revive it and make it taste nearly fresh-baked again.</p>
                <h2>The Science of Stale Bread</h2>
                <p>First, what makes bread go stale? It's not about drying out, as many people think. It's a process called "starch retrogradation," where the starch molecules in the bread crystallize and force water out of the granules. This process happens fastest at refrigerator temperatures, which is why you shouldn't store bread in the fridge!</p>
                <h2>The Water and Heat Method</h2>
                <p>This trick works by rehydrating the starches. Here's how to do it:</p>
                <p><strong>1. Wet the bread:</strong> Quickly run the entire loaf of stale bread under the tap. Don't soak it, just get the crust evenly damp.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Heat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to around 150°C (300°F).</p>
                <p><strong>3. Bake it:</strong> Place the damp loaf directly on the oven rack and bake for 6 to 10 minutes, depending on its size. The water on the crust turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread's interior, while the heat re-crisps the crust.</p>
                <p>When you take it out, you'll have a warm, crusty loaf with a soft, fluffy inside. This trick <strong>works best on whole loaves with a thick crust</strong>, like sourdough or a baguette. Just be sure to eat it soon, as it will go stale again faster the second time around!</p>

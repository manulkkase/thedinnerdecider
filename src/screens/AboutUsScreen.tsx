          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Itâ€™s a scene we all know too well: endless scrolling through delivery apps, the back-and-forth "I don't know, what do you want to eat?" conversation, and the feeling that you've forgotten every food you've ever enjoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were tired of the decision fatigue. We believed that choosing a meal should be fun, not a chore. So, we decided to turn it into a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Dinner Decider</strong> was born from that simple idea. It's a tool designed to bring a little bit of fun and randomness back into your daily food choices. Whether you need to declare a clear winner between a few options or you're looking for some mystical inspiration from the universe, we've got you covered.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple: to make deciding what to eat an easy, exciting, and enjoyable experience. We want to help you break out of your food rut, discover new dishes, and settle the age-old dinner debate once and for all.
